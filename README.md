# MREB
Multimodal Reasoning and Ethics Benchmark (MREB) is an open source benchmark designed to assess the cross-domain capabilities of AI models. Currently I am comparing local llms via ollama

MREB provides a standardized way to evaluate LLMs by:
- Testing cross-domain capabilities
- Providing consistent scoring metrics
- Enabling fair comparison between different models
- Focusing on practical, real-world applications

The fun part? All of the llms are run locally on my pc. Check more about my pc building experience [here](https://saiyashwanth.tech/pcbuild)

## 🏆 Leaderboard Structure

The leaderboard displays:
```
Model Name | Code Score | Logic Score | Ethics Score | Multimodal Score | Overall Score
```
