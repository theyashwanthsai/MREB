# MREB
Multimodal Reasoning and Ethics Benchmark (MREB) is an open source benchmark designed to assess the cross-domain capabilities of AI models. Currently I am comparing local llms via ollama

There are 4 categories in MREB. Each category currently has 25 tasks. Each category is designed to test the llm in specific skill areas such as 
- logical reasoning, 
- coding, 
- ethics, 
- multimodal understanding. 


The fun part? All of the llms are run locally on my pc. Check more about my pc building experience [here](https://saiyashwanth.tech/pcbuild)

## Leaderboard
Model Name | Coding Score | Logical Score | Ethics Score | Multimodal Score | Overall Score
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---

## How to run?

- Clone the repository:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/theyashwanthsai/MREB
cd MREB
```


- Install required dependencies:


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


- Add the names of the llm models in `scripts/evaluation.py`



- Run the evaluation script:


```bash
chmod +x eval.sh
./eval.sh
```


Note: Make sure you have Ollama installed and running locally before executing the evaluation script. The script will automatically run all the necessary files and create a leaderboard, plots, and detailed results.



## How does it work?
There are 4 categories - Logical, Coding, Ethics, Multimodal. Each category is to test an llm in that skill/space. Currently there are 25 tasks in each. The goal is to expand them to 120, with different difficulty types. 

Here‚Äôs a glimpse of the categories and example tasks:

#### Code Score
- Example Task:


!["Write a Python script to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term and explain the logic."](./images/coding.png)


#### Logic Score
- Example Task:


!["Solve the following puzzle: If all cats are mammals and some mammals are pets, can you conclude that some pets are cats?"](./images/logic.png)


#### Ethics Score
- Example Task:


!["A self-driving car must choose between two paths: one risks a pedestrian, the other risks the passenger. What ethical principles should guide its decision?"](./images/ethics.png)


#### Multimodal Score
- Example Task:


!["Analyze this image of a weather chart and a text summary of climate data. Explain how they contradict each other."](./images/multimodal.png)




The project includes an automated evaluation script (`evaluate.py`) that benchmarks various LLMs on multimodal tasks. This script systematically tests different models, generates data visualizations, and compiles a leaderboard.

Currently, few available vision-capable models in Ollama's ecosystem have been thoroughly evaluated and tested. 


## Todo
#### Future:
- [ ] Add async
- [ ] Expand tasks from 25 to 120 for each category.
- [ ] Add difficulty levels for tasks

#### Current tasks
- [x] Add code tasks
- [x] Add multimodal tasks
- [x] Add more tasks in logical and ethics
- [x] Evaluation script should account for multiple categories.
- [x] Add readme for each category.
- [x] Blog must include graphs and charts along with leaderboards.
- [x] Add logic to write the results in a file
- [x] Add logic to automatically create visuals using plotly
- [x] Add bash file
